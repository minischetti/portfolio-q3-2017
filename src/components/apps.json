He's since lived in Florida, Michigan and now resides in California working for Williams-Sonoma, Inc. as a Front-end Engineer. Programming doesn't stop outside of work, where he finds himself becoming ever-proficient in the likes of React, Webpack and other modern web technologies. His interests reach beyond programming and into the depths of design, typography and animation. If he's not programming, you'll likely find him guitar in-hand, writing a new song with the dream of propelling himself to rockstar status.",
